# Projects

## Capital Requirements and Bank Lendings

Final Project for the course _"Research Module in Financial Economics"_

__Project Description:__ Measuring the impact of capital requirements with Basel Framework on the loan supply to the nonfinancial firms. Obtaining a firm-level data, diff-in-diff design might be appropriate.

## Analyzing SEC 10-K Filings: A FinBERT Approach

Final Project for the course _"OSE Scientific Computing for Economists"_

__Project Description:__ In this study, I employed state-of-the-art NLP techniques to analyze SEC 10-K corporate filings, applying a specialized variant of BERT known as FinBERT. By focusing on the "Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis" (MD&A) section, I collected and analyzed text data from randomly selected 10-K filings published by U.S. publicly traded companies in 2020 and 2021. In addition, I conducted a comparative analysis of model performance by applying four distinct models, namely, FinBERT, fine-tuned FinBERT, feature extraction models utilizing a vanilla neural network, and a Random Forest Classifier, on the `financial_phrasebank` dataset.
