# About Me

I am currently a master's student in Economics at Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn. I received my bachelor's degrees in Sociology and Economics at Koç University and completed a track program in Finance and Macroeconomic Policies and Financial Markets. 

During my undergraduate studies, I worked with Prof. Erdem Yörük on the role of contentious politics in the old-age pension reforms. Moreover, I have studied advanced data analysis in Python and Generalized Linear Models in R with Dr. David Carlson.

My research interests lie in financial markets and computational finance.
