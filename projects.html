      <li><strong>Firm Size Premium: Productivity vs. Rent Sharing — Evidence from Matched Employer–Employee Data</strong> (with Mahmut Ablay)
          <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> We exploit Turkish matched employer–employee data to quantify the level and evolution of the large-firm wage premium (LFWP). Employing worker- and firm-fixed-effects models, we show that larger firms pay higher wages for two reasons: (i) composition/sorting—large firms employ more productive workers—and (ii) firm-specific pay premia, whereby observationally similar workers earn more at larger firms. The overall LFWP remains sizable but has weakened in recent years; this decline is driven primarily by a narrowing of firm-specific pay premia between large and small firms, whereas the sorting of high-skill workers into high-paying large firms has remained relatively stable. Decomposing the pay-premia gap, we find that it is largely accounted for by rent-sharing differentials between large and small firms, with productivity differences playing a smaller role. The narrowing of the LFWP can be attributed to declining rent-sharing differentials, while the contribution of the productivity channel has remained relatively stable over time, suggesting structural changes in the Turkish labor market.</p>

          <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> This paper examines the role of monetary policy announcements in explaining the long-run decline in global real interest rates. Using daily data on ten-year government bond yields for six advanced economies, I construct narrow three-day windows around national and U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings to isolate yield movements driven by monetary policy. Consistent with Hillenbrand (2022), I find that yield declines around FOMC windows account for a substantial portion of the secular fall in long-term rates across major economies, whereas domestic central bank announcements exhibit weaker explanatory power. The estimated spillovers are particularly pronounced for Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada, but limited for Switzerland and Australia, reflecting the influence of exchange-rate regimes, unconventional policy tools, and financial frictions. Instrumental-variable estimates suggest that foreign-exchange market illiquidity dampens these spillovers. The findings highlight the global transmission of U.S. monetary policy and its contribution to the secular decline in real interest rates.</p>

          <p>Final Project for the course <em>"Research Module in Financial Economics"</em></p>
          <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> I demonstrate that European banks increased lending during the COVID-19 pandemic with countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) releases. Amidst heterogeneous economic shock due to the pandemic, national authorities started adjusting CCyB rates as of March 2020. Employing a difference-in-differences strategy, I conjecture that countries that have higher initial mortality rates are more likely to increase the supply of loans with declining buffer rates. The results underscore that the adjustments of CCyB rates led to the intended outcome of increasing loan supply, particularly in countries that faced a more severe onset of the pandemic.</p>

          <!--<p>Final Project for the course <em>"OSE Scientific Computing for Economists"</em></p> -->
          <!--<p><strong>Project Description:</strong> In this study, I employed state-of-the-art NLP techniques to analyze SEC 10-K corporate filings, applying a specialized variant of BERT known as FinBERT. By focusing on the "Management’s Discussion and Analysis" (MD&A) section, I collected and analyzed text data from randomly selected 10-K filings published by U.S. publicly traded companies in 2020 and 2021. In addition, I conducted a comparative analysis of model performance by applying four distinct models, namely, FinBERT, fine-tuned FinBERT, feature extraction models utilizing a vanilla neural network, and a Random Forest Classifier, on the <code>financial_phrasebank</code> dataset.</p>-->
