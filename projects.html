          <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> This paper asks whether the secular decline in long-term interest rates in advanced economies is mainly a structural phenomenon or is concentrated in narrow windows around monetary policy announcements. Extending Hillenbrand (2025), I construct 3-day windows around FOMC and domestic monetary policy decisions and examine 10-year government bond yields. Three results emerge. First, there is substantial cross-country heterogeneity in yield responses to U.S. and domestic announcements, with responses that vary markedly across economies, but with FOMC announcements—far more than domestic policy decisions—systematically accounting for a larger share of long-maturity yield variation in most countries. Second, pooling all FOMC windows, declines in U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are accompanied by declines in foreign 10-year yields. Third, spillover coefficients are larger when FX bid-ask spreads are wider, consistent with tighter financial conditions amplifying U.S. shocks. </p>

          <p>Final Project for the course <em>"Research Module in Financial Economics"</em></p>
          <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> I demonstrate that European banks increased lending during the COVID-19 pandemic with countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) releases. Amidst heterogeneous economic shock due to the pandemic, national authorities started adjusting CCyB rates as of March 2020. Employing a difference-in-differences strategy, I conjecture that countries that have higher initial mortality rates are more likely to increase the supply of loans with declining buffer rates. The results underscore that the adjustments of CCyB rates led to the intended outcome of increasing loan supply, particularly in countries that faced a more severe onset of the pandemic.</p>

          <!--<p>Final Project for the course <em>"OSE Scientific Computing for Economists"</em></p> -->
          <!--<p><strong>Project Description:</strong> In this study, I employed state-of-the-art NLP techniques to analyze SEC 10-K corporate filings, applying a specialized variant of BERT known as FinBERT. By focusing on the "Management’s Discussion and Analysis" (MD&A) section, I collected and analyzed text data from randomly selected 10-K filings published by U.S. publicly traded companies in 2020 and 2021. In addition, I conducted a comparative analysis of model performance by applying four distinct models, namely, FinBERT, fine-tuned FinBERT, feature extraction models utilizing a vanilla neural network, and a Random Forest Classifier, on the <code>financial_phrasebank</code> dataset.</p>-->
